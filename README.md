# CG Utils


## Goal
The goal of this project is to make it ease for every CG artist to find and install usefull tools. The focus will be
free and open source tools.

## Usage
The goal is to have one installer that first installs REZ and python and registers the directory for rez packages. Then
all the listed tools may be installed as rez packages. On top of that, there should a launcher provided that lists 
available DCCs and launches the selected DCC with proper rez environment to make the installed tools avaliable.
